In recent years, “work calls”, in which multiple people work on individual tasks while sharing time via a call tool, have become widely used.
The purpose of this study is to support casual matching between users who have the same working preference but have weak relationship with each other in a work call inviting participants on SNS.
This study proposes a visualization method of how to proceed with a work call focusing on the dialogue atmosphere and a participant recruitment system using the visualization method.
This study uses machine learning to estimate the dialogue atmosphere.
The model is constructed using speech state temporal features that can provide highly accurate estimation of dialogue atmosphere while ensuring the privacy of participants.
This study constructs and verifies a model for estimating the atmosphere of a working conversation held with 2 to 4 speakers.
